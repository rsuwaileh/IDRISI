# IDRISI
**IDRISI-R** is the largest-scale publicly-available Twitter Location Mention Recognition (LMR) dataset, in both English and Arabic languages. Named after [_Muhammad Al-Idrisiüë≥üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Idrisi), who is one of the pioneers and founders of the advanced geography. The "R" refers to the **r**ecognition task. IDRISI-R contains 41 disaster events of different types (e.g., floods, earthquakes, fires, etc.) that occurred in a wide geographical area of the English- and Arabic-speaking countries across continents. The annotated LMs were also labeled for different coarse- (e.g., country, city) and fine-grained location types (e.g., streets, POIs). The detailed statistics are provided below.


## Data Release
This dataset is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).
You can download the IDRISI-R datasets from `data` directory that has the following naming structure: `data/<language>/<version>-<setup>-<format>`

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: we are not releasing the _test_ partitions of all datasets since they are used for evaluation in the [ITU GeoAI Challange: Location Mention Recognition from Social Media Crisis-related Text](https://geoaichallenge.aiforgood.itu.int/match/matchitem/64). 

**IDRISI-R** is released in two **_versions_**: 
- `gold`: around 20K and 4.6K human-labeled tweets for English and Arabic, respectively. The annotation was collected using crowd and in-house workers for English and Arabic, respectively. 
- `silver`: around 57K and 1.2M automatically annotated English and Arabic tweets, respectively. The annotation was done using the best-performing LMR models.

The tweet datasets naturally support two processing **_setups_** that are:
- `time-based`: tweets are chronologically-ordered.
- `random`: tweets are shuffled randomly while discarding their timestamps.
 
We release the datasets in both `JSONL` and `BILOU` **_formats_**:
- `BILOU`:  NER token-based annotation scheme with 5 classes: Beginning, Inside, Last, Outside, and Unit.
- `JSONL`: every lines corresponds to one tweet with the following properties: `tweet_id`, `user_id`, `text`, `created_at`, `info_class` adopted from [humAID]( https://crisisnlp.qcri.org/humaid_dataset) and [Kwaraith]( https://github.com/alaa-a-a/kawarith) datasets, and `location_mentions`. 

Example:
```
{
  "tweet_id": "1061497252806414336",
  "user_id": "886453870120976384",
  "text": "Please read below!! Another devastating fire has hit Northern California, people need help, whatever you can give, or anyway you can help, please!!",
  "created_at": "Sun Nov 11 05:54:01 +0000 2018",
  "info_class": "requests_or_urgent_needs",
  "location_mentions": [
    {
      "text": "Northern California",
      "type": "STAT",
      "startIdx": 53,
      "endIdx": 72
    }
  ]
}
```

The `gold` version is available for both setups and formats. The `silver` version is available for `random` setup and `JSONL` format only.

We processed the data to de-identify it as follows:
- We do not release the the user identifiers, i.e., `user_id`.
- We replace the user mentions (i.e.,`@`) in the tweet text  by `@0` of the same length as the mention length. For example, if the mention is `@someuser`, we replace it with `@00000000`.

We keep the tweet ids, i.e., `id`, to allow recrawling tweets for extracting more information, e.g., meta data, social network properties, etc. This allows developing LMP models that utilize different features beyond the textual content.
