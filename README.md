# IDRISI
**IDRISI** is the largest-scale publicly-available Twitter Location Mention Prediction (LMP) dataset, in both English and Arabic languages. Named after [_Muhammad Al-Idrisiüë≥üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Idrisi), who is one of the pioneers and founders of the advanced geography. 

All datasets are licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).

- The Location Mention Recognition (LMR) datasets are under [LMR](https://github.com/rsuwaileh/IDRISI/tree/main/LMR) directory.
- The Location Mention Disambiguation (LMD) datasets will be available soon under [LMD](https://github.com/rsuwaileh/IDRISI/tree/main/LMD) directory.



We processed the data to de-identify it as follows:
- We do not release the the user identifiers, i.e., `user_id`.
- We replace the user mentions (i.e.,`@`) in the tweet text  by `@0` of the same length as the mention length. For example, if the mention is `@someuser`, we replace it with `@00000000`.

We keep the tweet ids, i.e., `id`, to allow recrawling tweets for extracting more information, e.g., meta data, social network properties, etc. This allows developing LMP models that utilize different features beyond the textual content.
